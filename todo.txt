track generation from image:
    - sample verticle pixels at regular intervals, if colour (line) then outside, inside, inside, outside, outside ...

track limits detection:
    - calculate using compute shader to iterate over cars
    - if x, y changes sides of a track limit then violation
    - possibly think of some way to optimize this to not have to check all track limits

lap timing:
    - possibly add start/finish line to track file
    - do not allow to pass back over finish line
    - count frames rather than time when deterministic

create genetic algorithm :)
train genetic algorithm :)
succeed in life :)
